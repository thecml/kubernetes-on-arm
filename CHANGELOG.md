## Changelog

 - v0.8.0
   - Upgraded to Kubernetes v1.3.6 and flannel v0.6.1
   - **Using official Kubernetes binaries and docker images**
     - They are built in line with my multi-platform proposal: [kubernetes/kubernetes#26863](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/26863)
   - Most of the code is "official" from [kube-deploy/docker-multinode](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-deploy/tree/master/docker-multinode)
   - All binaries and images are now cross-compiled from `amd64`, no more releasing from Raspberry Pis!
   - Using HypriotOS v1.0.1!
   - It's fully possible to add `amd64` nodes seamlessly with docker-multinode
     - Then you can control which nodes a pod should land on with the `beta.kubernetes.io/arch` label: [kubernetes/kubernetes#23684](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/23684)
   - Made the dns and the dashboard addons mandatory, they can't and shouldn't be disabled as they're required components of the core.
   - The earlier `skydns` component has been replaced with the new `kubedns` component that is more integrated with Kubernetes and more efficent.
   - Raspbian is supported out-of-the-box, just download the deb package and install on your Pi!
   - Pine64 is now supported as a platform.
   - Upgraded the addons:
     - dashboard to v1.1.1
     - kubedns to 1.5 (manifest version v17.1)
     - registry to v2.5.0
     - heapster to v1.2.0-beta.2
     - influxdb to v0.13.0
     - grafana to v3.1.1
   - Total refactor of `kube-config` and of the whole project; as much as possible official Kubernetes code is used, which means the configuration for v0.8.0 is more generic than v0.7.0 which was more specialized.
   - Added the helm package manager at version v2.0.0-alpha.3
   - kube-registry-proxy is now added to the registry addon which makes every node expose the registry at `localhost:5000`
   - Possible to use `--containerized` by adding `export USE_CONTAINERIZED=true` to `/etc/kubernetes/k8s.conf`
   - Renamed `kube-systemd` to `docker-multinode` and the generic `systemd` OS to the generic `debian` OS
   - Caveats:
    - Reboots aren't working nor supported. (Added to roadmap)
    - Arch Linux ARM, the Pine64 and Scaleway suffers from the `docker pull` mtu bug [docker/docker#22635](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/22635)

 - v0.7.0 (21th Mar 2016)
   - Upgrade to Kubernetes v1.2.0 [Changelog](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), dashboard v1.0.0, etcd v2.2.5, registry v2.3.1
   - Using official binaries built from my Kubernetes PR: [kubernetes/kubernetes#19769](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/19769)
   - Added cluster monitoring! Heapster v1.0.0, influxdb v0.10.3 and grafana v2.6.0
   - Changed to "native" kubelet mode. No more `--containerized` hack. Makes it possible to use Downward API
   - Switched to `host-gw` instead of `udp` as the default `flannel` backend for improved performance as [@larmog](https://github.com/larmog) suggested. Also made the option `FLANNEL_BACKEND` in `k8s.conf`
   - Compile `flannel` and `registry` statically. That reduces their total image size 147 MB
   - Deprecated and removed `luxas/raspbian` in favor for plain `resin/rpi-raspbian:jessie`
   - Added `master.json` to the hyperkube image so it's easy to spin up a one-node cluster as `docker.md` in official docs does.
   - Using [@hypriot](https://github.com/hypriot)'s prebuilt Go tarballs for `luxas/go`. Will switch to official `go1.6` soon.
   - Added experimental RancherOS to `sdcard/write.sh`, but no Kubernetes rootfs is available yet
   - Made the storage driver easily changeable with the `DOCKER_STORAGE_DRIVER` in `/etc/kubernetes/k8s.conf`
   - Changed indentation to spaces instead of tabs for the most of the files. Also trying to end all files with a newline.
   - Replaced `sleep` based timeouts in kube-config for condition based loops, makes it faster and more reliable
   - Added a debugging option in `kube-config` by specifying `K8S_DEBUG=1` before the command.
   - Fixed a HypriotOS/`.deb`-file issue where `sudo` modified the `$PATH` so `kube-config` couldn't find `kubectl` [@DorianGray](https://github.com/DorianGray)
   - More reliable SD Card creation by using `partprobe` [@DorianGray](https://github.com/DorianGray)
   - Lowered the `nodeMonitorGracePeriod` and the `podEvictionTimeout` as [@saturnism](https://github.com/saturnism) suggests
   - Changed proxying mode to `iptables` for better performance.
   - Added a script for cross-compiling Kubernetes to ARM 64-bit on a `amd64` host.
   - Other minor enhancements, improvements and bug fixes are included too.
 - v0.6.5 (14th Feb 2016)
   - Add a http loadbalancer. Thanks for the help @larmog
   - **Upgrade to and support docker-1.10.0 only**
   - **Kubernetes Dashboard UI added as an addon**
   - Do not depend on pacman, use a self-built statically linked ARMv6 docker-1.10 binary instead
   - Revert to userspace proxying, since iptables proxying had some bugs in it
   - Better documentation
   - A worker may now reboot and come up again in some minutes

   - Fixed so the master is able to collect logs from nodes @kyletravis
   - Better DNS management on Arch Linux
   - Use a shell for looking up paths to executables needed in `.service` files
   - Easier to use on `systemd`, most of the packages is automatically installed
 - v0.6.2 (26th Dec 2015)
   - Support for Banana Pro
   - `.deb` package deployment
   - `iptables` proxying mode for `kube-proxy` should result in better performance

   - **Support for HypriotOS**
   - Support for plain `systemd` OSes
   - Enabled experimental Kubernetes by default, e.g. `Jobs`, `HorizontalPodAutoscaler`
   - k8s => 1.1.3, etcd => 2.2.2, flannel => 0.5.5, registry => 2.2.1
   - **Started to hack on mainline k8s: [kubernetes/kubernetes#17981](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/17981)**
   - Renamed `kube-archlinux` to the more generic `kube-systemd`
   - Small improvments and much better README

   - Now it's possible to build the Kubernetes binaries with Go 1.5.1, but it's much slower so it's not default
   - Add some test scripts for even more automation
   - Fix the bug that makes this not run on armv6, e.g. Raspberry Pi 1
   - Add windows downloads
   - Now `ServiceAccount` `secrets` are working as they should
